My name is Vicente Lisboa, and I am a Spanish/Chilean national with a passion for data analysis, project management and sports. With a Industrial Engineering degree from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, I have gained experience in various roles, ranging from data analyst for the Ministry of Health to project manager at Shift SpA.

In my recent role at the Ministry of Health, I designed management control mechanisms and capitalized on opportunities of strategic processes in the context of the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic. I also automated processes and products of periodic publication while coordinating with regional health teams. As a project manager at Shift SpA, I was responsible for the development, execution, and evaluation of consulting projects and the implementation of Workforce Management software in Latin America.

I have completed relevant coursework in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Text Mining, Networks, and Reinforcement Learning, and I am currently pursuing a Master's Program in Data Science at the Barcelona School of Economics. Through my experiences, I have developed skills in team leadership, communication, and data analysis, and I am excited to continue developing my abilities in data science and project management.
